# TODOs

- use cached fonts to avoid loading them again and again
- apply simple svg optimizations (e.g. remove metadata, don't pretty print)
- dedicated tests for. e.g. for:
    - different fonts
    - multiple fonts
- test and handle different styles of a font. Currently, I'm only supporting 400/regular.
- file watch mode
